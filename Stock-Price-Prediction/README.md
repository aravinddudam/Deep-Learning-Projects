This project focuses on stock price prediction, specifically forecasting market stock prices for the next day using LSTM and RNN deep learning models. Leveraging historical USD Uber data, the models are trained to capture temporal patterns and dependencies in stock market movements. While not guaranteeing absolute accuracy due to the complexities of financial markets, successful outcomes from this project could revolutionize investment strategies and risk management practices. The project highlights the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in the financial domain, enhancing decision-making processes for investors and traders.
